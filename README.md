# Place3D

Basically a 3D version of place made in JS. Still a lot of work to do but it's a decent proof of concept right now.


### Controls
- **Mouse Click**: Place or replace cubes
- **Mouse Drag**: Rotate the camera view
- **Mouse Scroll**: Cycle through colors

### Tips
- Save your work regularly using the Save Image button, this will probably crash lol

## Technical Details

### Built With
- **Three.js**: 3D graphics library for WebGL rendering
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No framework dependencies
- **CSS3**: Modern styling with gradients and animations
- **HTML5**: No notes... You kinda haff too sooooo

### Browser Compatibility
- Should work with everything, unless you are on mobile, screw you guys and your touch controls :|

### Performance
- Runs at 60fps on pretty much anything
- Hardware-accelerated 3D rendering

## TODO

Potential features for future versions:
- **Multiplayer Support**: Real-time collaboration with other users
- **RGB Colors**: Color picker for unlimited color options
- **Export Options**: 3D model export (OBJ, STL)
- **Mobile**: Touch controls for mobile devices
